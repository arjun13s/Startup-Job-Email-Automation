Doordash,SUMMER 2013,,,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/doordash,http://doordash.com,Potential Collaboration Opportunity,"Dear DoorDash Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Math, and I have a strong background in analyzing and resolving infrastructure issues, as demonstrated during my time at OnX. Additionally, I have successfully managed a stock portfolio that grew from $400 to $8,000 over four years, showcasing my analytical skills and strategic thinking.

I am particularly interested in exploring opportunities to contribute to DoorDash's growth and innovation. I believe my experience in both technical problem-solving and financial analysis could add value to your team.

Thank you for considering my outreach. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to DoorDash.

Best regards,
